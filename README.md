t-test analyses

The analysis starts by examining the normality of the data distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test for both groups. If either groupâ€™s data is not normally distributed or if the variances are unequal (checked with the Levene test), the code automatically switches to the Mann-Whitney U test, which is a non-parametric alternative. If both normality and equal variance assumptions are met, a two-sided t-test is performed to compare the means of the two groups. This automated approach ensures that the appropriate statistical test is used based on the characteristics of the data.
