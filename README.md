# t_test
T test analyses

The script generates synthetic datasets with normal or uniform distributions and performs statistical tests to compare them. It automatically selects the appropriate test (t-test or Mann-Whitney U test) based on normality and variance checks, then saves the results to text files and histograms as PNG images. Setting a working directory ensures organized storage of all output files.
